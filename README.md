# Number Guessing Game

## Rules of the Game:

* If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
* If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
* If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.
## Implementation Details
* The program generates a random number between a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
* The user has limited attempts (K tries) to guess the number.
## At each guess, the program provides a hint:
* If the guessed number is higher, it tells the user to guess lower.
* If the guessed number is lower, it tells the user to guess higher.
* If the user guesses correctly, they win.
* If all attempts are exhausted, the game reveals the correct number.
