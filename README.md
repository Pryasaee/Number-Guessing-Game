# Number Guessing Game

## Rules of the Game:

* If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
* If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
* If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.
## Implementation Details
* The program generates a random number between a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
* The user has limited attempts (K tries) to guess the number.
## At each guess, the program provides a hint:
1.If the guessed number is higher, it tells the user to guess lower.
2.If the guessed number is lower, it tells the user to guess higher.
3.If the user guesses correctly, they win.
4.If all attempts are exhausted, the game reveals the correct number.
